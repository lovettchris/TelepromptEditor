00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05
This animation shows messages passing through a highly parallel distributed system.

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:09
Each node represents a micro-service or a piece of code running on some machine.

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:15
Messages are flying through this system in a way that is hard to debug when something goes wrong.

4
00:00:15 --> 00:00:23
Coyote tests one async path at a time exploring all possible paths through the system and it does this very quickly.

5
00:00:23 --> 00:00:29
It also records this path so that when it finds a bug that bug is 100% reproducible.
